# CLI Reference

Complete command reference for `portzilla`. For a high-level overview, see [`README.md`](../README.md).

## Commands

Every command accepts `--json` to print a single JSON value on stdout instead of human-readable text. Every command reads and writes the same file-locked JSON state file, so concurrent invocations from different processes are serialized safely.

### `portzilla claim <PORT> --tag <TAG> [--pid <PID>] [--session <SESSION>] [--json]`

Claims `<PORT>` for the given (or default) PID and tag.

- `--tag <TAG>` — required. Human-readable description of what the port is for.
- `--pid <PID>` — optional. Defaults to the PID of the parent process (the shell or agent invoking `portzilla`); falls back to `portzilla`'s own PID if the parent cannot be determined.
- `--session <SESSION>` — optional. Groups related leases under a session identifier.
- `--json` — print the outcome as JSON instead of a one-line summary.

Conflict resolution:

- No lease on the requested port, or the existing lease's owning PID is dead: the port is claimed (or re-taken) directly. Not reassigned.
- A live lease on the requested port already owned by the same PID: the lease is updated in place (idempotent re-claim — tag and session can change, the port does not). Not reassigned.
- A live lease on the requested port owned by a different PID: `portzilla` finds the next free port at or after `requested_port + 1` (skipping ports with a live lease and ports the OS reports as bound) and claims that instead. Reassigned.

### `portzilla ls [--json]`

Lists every recorded lease. Human output is a table (`PORT PID STATUS AGE TAG`); JSON output is an array of lease objects (see shape below).

### `portzilla who <PORT> [--json]`

Shows the lease recorded on `<PORT>`. Exits with code `2` and prints nothing to stdout if no lease exists on that port.

### `portzilla release <PORT> [--json]`

Removes the lease recorded on `<PORT>` and prints the removed lease. Exits with code `2` if no lease exists on that port. If the owning PID is still alive at the time of release, a warning is printed to stderr (`release` always wins — it does not check ownership or refuse to act).

### `portzilla prune [--json]`

Removes every lease whose owning PID is no longer alive and prints each one that was removed. Human output prints `no dead leases to prune` if nothing was pruned; JSON output prints `[]`.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0`  | Success |
| `1`  | Unexpected error (I/O failure, corrupt state file, lock failure) |
| `2`  | Requested lease not found (`who` / `release` on a port with no lease) |

## JSON output shapes

### Lease object (`ls`, `who`, `release`, `prune`)

Used as a single object by `who` and `release`, and as an array of these objects by `ls` and `prune`:

```json
{
  "port": 3001,
  "pid": 57108,
  "tag": "vite-dev",
  "created_at": 1785959877,
  "session": null,
  "age_secs": 3,
  "alive": true
}
```

`created_at` is a Unix timestamp in seconds. `session` is `null` unless `--session` was given at claim time. `alive` reflects a live PID-table check at the moment of the query, not a cached value.

### Claim outcome (`claim --json`)

```json
{
  "port": 3001,
  "pid": 57285,
  "tag": "vite-dev",
  "created_at": 1785959898,
  "session": null,
  "requested_port": 3000,
  "reassigned": true
}
```

`requested_port` is the port that was originally asked for; `port` is the port actually leased. `reassigned` is `true` only when `port != requested_port` because of a live conflicting claim.

## MCP server

`portzilla serve --mcp` runs an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server over stdio, exposing `claim`, `who`, `ls`, `release`, and `prune` as MCP tools (those are the registered tool names — no `portzilla_` prefix). This is for AI coding agents with MCP tool access (Claude Code, and any other MCP client): they call `who` the same way they call any other structured tool — typed JSON in, typed JSON out — instead of shelling out to the CLI and parsing text.

Register it with Claude Code:

```console
$ claude mcp add portzilla -- portzilla serve --mcp
```

Every tool's description is written to make the intended behavior explicit to the calling agent — the `claim` tool description, for example, says outright to use it *instead of* killing whatever occupies a port. Tool results use the exact same flat JSON shapes documented above for `--json` output (see JSON output shapes), so anything already written against the CLI's JSON recognizes MCP results too.

- **`claim(port, tag, pid?, session?)`** — same semantics as `portzilla claim`. `pid` is optional here for a different reason than on the CLI: there is no meaningful "parent process" to default to (the MCP client, not a shell, owns the session), so an omitted `pid` falls back to the portzilla server process's own PID — almost never what you want — and the result carries an extra `note` field saying so. Always pass the PID of the process you started (or are about to start) on that port when you have it.
- **`who(port)`** — same semantics as `portzilla who`.
- **`ls()`** — same semantics as `portzilla ls`, no arguments.
- **`release(port)`** — same semantics as `portzilla release`, including the still-alive warning (surfaced as a `was_alive` field on the result instead of a stderr line).
- **`prune()`** — same semantics as `portzilla prune`, no arguments.

**Errors**: a missing lease (`who`/`release` on a port with no lease) comes back as a *tool-level* error — the JSON-RPC call still succeeds, but the tool result is flagged `isError: true` with a structured `{"error": "not_found", "port": ..., "message": ...}` body. This mirrors the CLI's exit code `2`: it is an expected, well-formed outcome the calling agent should see and act on, not a protocol failure. Actual portzilla failures (I/O errors, corrupt state, lock failures — the CLI's exit code `1`) come back as real JSON-RPC protocol errors instead, since those mean the server itself couldn't do its job.

The MCP server reads and writes the exact same locked `leases.json` the CLI does (respecting `PORTZILLA_DATA_DIR`) — it is a second front end onto the same on-disk state, not a separate store.

## Input validation

- `claim` rejects port 0 (clap range 1..=65535); the same check exists in `Store::claim` so any other caller (MCP, direct library use) hits it too.
- `tag` is capped at 1024 characters and `session` at 512; oversized values are rejected with a clear error before the store is touched.
- Hook runners cap stdin at 1 MiB; over-cap inputs are treated like a malformed payload.

## Data file location

`portzilla` resolves its data directory in this order:

1. `PORTZILLA_DATA_DIR` environment variable, used directly as the data directory.
2. `$XDG_DATA_HOME/portzilla`.
3. `$HOME/.local/share/portzilla`.

The state lives at `<data_dir>/leases.json`, a pretty-printed JSON array of lease objects, written atomically (write to a temp file, then rename) and guarded by an exclusive file lock at `<data_dir>/leases.json.lock` for the duration of every read-modify-write operation.

Set `PORTZILLA_DATA_DIR` to isolate tests, CI runs, or throwaway experiments from your real lease store.
